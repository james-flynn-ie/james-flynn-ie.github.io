## Project Euler

### What is Project Euler?

`Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.`

_<https://projecteuler.net/about>_

The purpose of these repositories is to share solutions to the [problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives), and to help each other improve as programmers by sharing solutions and suggesting ways to improve the code.
