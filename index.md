# Welcome to [James Flynn](https://github.com/james-flynn-ie)'s GitHub Pages

Hello and welcome to my web page, hosted by GitHub Pages.

Here you will find a bit about me, as well as some links to my current projects.

If you would like to contribute to any of the projects, then please follow one of the project links and check out the Contributing Guide.

### About Me

By day, I'm a DevOps Engineer living and working in Cork, Ireland. By night, I'm an Open Source Contributor.

My hobbies include learning new programming languages and tools through Open Source Software (naturally), reading Sci-Fi, Xbox gaming and spending quality time with the dogs.

I'm really interested in learning and contributing to up-and-coming languages and technologies, so please reach out to me if you are involved in an Open Source Software project and think I could be of help to you.
