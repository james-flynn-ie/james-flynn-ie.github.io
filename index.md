## About Me

<div class="LI-profile-badge"  data-version="v1" data-size="medium" data-locale="en_IE" data-type="horizontal" data-theme="dark" data-vanity="jamesflynnie"><a class="LI-simple-link" href='https://ie.linkedin.com/in/jamesflynnie?trk=profile-badge'>James Flynn</a></div>

I'm a DevOps Engineer living and working in Cork, Ireland.

By night, I'm an Open Source Contributor.

My hobbies include learning new programming languages and tools through Open Source Software, reading and watching Sci-Fi, Xbox gaming and spending quality time with the dogs.

I'm really interested in learning and contributing to up-and-coming languages and technologies, so please reach out to me if you are involved in an Open Source Software project and think I could be of help to you.

## GitHub Repositories

### Project Euler

Here are some of my favourite repos that I've created. Project Euler is a mathematical/computational problem website which encourages programmers to find efficient algorithms. They are a great way to learn new languages:

- [projectEulerGo](https://james-flynn-ie.github.io/projectEulerGo/README.html)

- [projectEulerJava](https://james-flynn-ie.github.io/projectEulerJava/README.html)

### Other Repositories

Please feel free to check out my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/james-flynn-ie) to see some of the other Open Source projects which I have contributed to:

If you see anything that you like, then please feel free to Star or Fork and contribute to any of the repositories.

## Enjoy!
